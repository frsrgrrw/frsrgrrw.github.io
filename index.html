        <p>I'm a machine learning researcher based in Edinburgh, Scotland. I am currently a PhD student at Edinburgh Centre for Robotics c/o Heriot-Watt University & the University of Edinburgh. I previously worked at the Alan Turing Institue in the AI for Cyber Defense team as a researcher.</p>
        
        <p>I'm interested in evolutionary computing, games, agent based learning and using ideas from evolutionary computing to make deep learning more robust. More broadly, I like cyber-defense, data-sci and data-vis, as well as hardware and robotics.</p>
