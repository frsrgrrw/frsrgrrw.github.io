Hello ðŸ‘‹. I'm Fraser. I'm a PhD student at <a href='https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/students/fraser-garrow'>Edinburgh Centre for Robotics</a> c/o <a href='http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fg28/'>Heriot-Watt University</a> & <a href='https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/students/Fraser_Garrow.html'>University of Edinburgh</a>.

I'm mostly interested in evolutionary program synthesis and program improvement (see [genetic programming](https://geneticprogramming.com/) and [genetic improvement](https://geneticprogramming.com/) for some very general information). I am especially interested in the evolution of software using purely functional programming languages, like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, data science and visualisations, and robotics in general.
